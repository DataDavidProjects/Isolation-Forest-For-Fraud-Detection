# Isolation-Forest-For-Fraud-Detection
Master Degree Thesis Data Analytics for Business


> Developing an effective fraud detection system is a complex process that
> typically requires more than one technique. The majority of tools fully approved
> by regulators are explicit rules, often inconsistent with the fast pace of time and
> technology. Although simulated transactions are purely demonstrative, they are
> a valuable tool for experimenting new techniques and support the development
> of fraud detection models. Investigators should supervise the development
> of new rules and features to spot anomalies, and seek continuous feedback
> from users and ex former fraudsters. As part of a Data Driven Layer, Isolation
> Forest can help existing methods to perform better and avoid explicit rules that
> might be fooled by more experienced fraudsters. Creating Features related to
> customer spending and information about previous risks over time seems a key
> element also in difficult fraud scenarios and prevent a drift in performance. Class
> Imbalance seems also a problem for many supervised models, and isolation
> forest performed well and stayed consistent. Furthermore, the use of a flexible
> alert can be of a good use in moments when policy makers or management
> requires more attention or less friction in the payment system. Investing in data
> collection and cloud computing solutions can help minimize the latency between
> registration and validity of transactions. However, it is essential to ensure data
> protection and address the trade-off between compliance and efficiency.
