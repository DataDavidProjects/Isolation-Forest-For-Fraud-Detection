# Isolation-Forest-For-Fraud-Detection
Master Degree Thesis Data Analytics for Business

"Developing an effective fraud detection system is a complex process that
typically requires more than one technique. The majority of tools fully approved
by regulators are explicit rules, often inconsistent with the fast pace of time and
technology. Although simulated transactions are purely demonstrative, they are
a valuable tool for experimenting new techniques and support the development
of fraud detection models. Investigators should supervise the development
of new rules and features to spot anomalies, and seek continuous feedback
from users and ex former fraudsters. As part of a Data Driven Layer, Isolation
Forest can help existing methods to perform better and avoid explicit rules that
might be fooled by more experienced fraudsters. Creating Features related to
customer spending and information about previous risks over time seems a key
element also in difficult fraud scenarios and prevent a drift in performance. Class
Imbalance seems also a problem for many supervised models, and isolation
forest performed well and stayed consistent. Furthermore, the use of a flexible
alert can be of a good use in moments when policy makers or management
requires more attention or less friction in the payment system. Investing in data
collection and cloud computing solutions can help minimize the latency between
registration and validity of transactions. However, it is essential to ensure data
protection and address the trade-off between compliance and efficiency.
