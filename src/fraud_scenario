Scenario 1:
    Any transaction whose amount is more than 220 is a fraud.
    This scenario is not inspired by a real-world scenario.
    Rather, it will provide an obvious fraud pattern that should be detected by any baseline fraud detector.
    This will be useful to validate the implementation of a fraud detection technique.



Scenario 2:
    Every day, a list of two terminals is drawn at random.
    All transactions on these terminals in the next 28 days will be marked as fraudulent.
    This scenario simulates a criminal use of a terminal, through phishing for example.
    Detecting this scenario will be possible by adding features that keep track of the number of fraudulent transactions on the terminal.
    Since the terminal is only compromised for 28 days, additional strategies that involve concept drift will need to be designed to efficiently deal with this scenario.


Scenario 3:
    Every day, a list of 3 customers is drawn at random.
    In the next 14 days, 1/3 of their transactions have their amounts multiplied by 5 and marked as fraudulent.
    This scenario simulates a card-not-present fraud where the credentials of a customer have been leaked.
    The customer continues to make transactions, and transactions of higher values are made by the fraudster who tries to maximize their gains.
    Detecting this scenario will require adding features that keep track of the spending habits of the customer.
    As for scenario 2, since the card is only temporarily compromised, additional strategies that involve concept drift should also be designed.
